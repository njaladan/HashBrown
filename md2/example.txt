1. padding until bytes are a multiple of 16
	a. pad even if it's already a multiple of 16 (pad with another 16 bytes then)
	b. pad by adding "i" bytes of value "i" 
		presumably like 4 4 4 4
		i think so you can't scam it with adding a byte and getting away with the same signature
2. append the checksum
	a. 

whats the easiest way to store a lookup table inside a class that should be easy to read?


initially misunderstood something - i thought that the bytes being padded were sequential, but apparently its jsut the same numebr
	either way same level of security i think (can't get two of the same hashes)


turns out the rfc was wrong (there was an extra xor necessary) rip
