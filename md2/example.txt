1. padding until bytes are a multiple of 16
	a. pad even if it's already a multiple of 16 (pad with another 16 bytes then)
	b. pad by adding "i" bytes of value "i" 
		presumably like 4 4 4 4
		i think so you can't scam it with adding a byte and getting away with the same signature
2. append the checksum
	a. 



wait wtf it's only 5 steps long who would've thunk it.
