step 1: padding
the rfc is written in the manner of bits, but in this case i'll just be working with bytes, so it's not as bad
if the message is 56 mod 64 bytes, then add one byte of 0x10000000 and like 63 empty bytes
	if not, add the appropriate amount but the first byte is always 0x10000000

step 2: append length
we add the length of the original message in 64 bits (don't worry about the case where it's more becuase that's 2 exabytes LoL)
